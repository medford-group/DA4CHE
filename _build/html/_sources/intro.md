# Introduction

This Jupterbook is derived from a collection of notes, originally developed as a part of the "Data Analytics for Chemical Engineers" course at Georgia Tech (ChBE 4745/6745). The [original notes](https://github.com/medford-group/data_analytics_ChE) have been re-organized into this Jupyterbook format to make it easier to navigate, and in the process some re-organization and refining was done. Several AI assistant tools were used in this conversion process, and while all content has been manually reviewed, some artifacts may still be present. At present, this version is still in "beta testing", and the transition is not complete. Hopefully, the full transition will be done by Fall 2026. If you find any issues with these notes, including significant discrepancies from the original version or just suggestions for improvements, please open an "issue" on the Github page (preferred) or email [A.J. Medford](mailto:ajm@gatech.edu).

# Attributions

These notes have been collected, refined, and revised numerous times over the years, and it is impossible to directly attribute all ideas and notes to their original sources. Links or references are included in the notes where ideas or quotes are taken directly. I also want to give credit to the many fantastic resources and blog posts from Prof. John Kitchin, who is a pioneer of Python and data science education in chemical engineering, and I strongly recommend his ["PyCSE" book](https://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/book/intro.html#) for anyone (especially engineers) who are just getting started with Python. In addition, I am grateful to the general openness of the machine learning community, which has provided access to both code and helpful blog posts and other learning resources -- the content created by Sebastian Raschka was particularly useful in creating the first version of the course. The course textbooks, "Machine Learning Refined" and "Elements of Statistical Learning" were heavily influential when crafting the original version of the notes. Finally, I need to acknowledge that LLMs, including Claude and ChatGPT, were particularly useful when refining the notes, both by helping with menial tasks to set up the Jupterbook, and in providing additional suggestions of exercises and elaboration on the notes.
